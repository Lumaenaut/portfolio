            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. Do not overmix—some lumps are okay.</li>
                <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it.</li>
                <li>Pour ¼ cup of batter per pancake onto the hot surface. Cook until bubbles form on the top and the edges look set, about 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
            </ol>
